#describe data sets
#data_BPRSL has now 360 rows and 5 columns. Separate week columns were transformed to a one weeks column
#The week column was created by extracting the week number from the weeks column
#Treatment variable tells about which treatment group study subjects belonged to.
#Subject has subject number. There were 20 men in treatment 1- group and 20 to treatment 2. Hence the numbers
#bprs is a value for "brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS)" (quotes from the exercise texts)
#"The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; each of these is rated from one (not present) to seven (extremely severe).
#The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having schizophrenia."

#data_RATSL has 176 rows and 5 columns
#info on data set from exercise set:
#data from a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats. 
#The groups were put on different diets, and each animalâ€™s body weight (grams) was recorded repeatedly (approximately) weekly, except in week seven when two recordings were taken) over a 9-week period."
#ID column is ID of the rat
#Groups-column tells which diet group the rat belonged to
#WD tells which week the weight in weight-column was taken
#weight is recorded body weight in grams
#Time was mutated by extracting week number from WD

#Why longitunal data:
#"To be able to study the possible differences in the bprs value between the treatment groups and the possible change of the value in time"
#combined week/time column with longitunal data makes it possible to use certain statistical methods to study change over time in longitunal data
#therefore the separate week columns are mutated to one long format column
