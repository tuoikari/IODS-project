There are a few phases (don't worry: all this will become an easy routine for you very soon!):

    First, select the "Git" tab in the upper right corner of RStudio. You will see a list of modified files.
    Select "Commit". It will open a new "Review Changes" window showing more detailed information of the changes you have made in each file since the previous version.
    Tick the box in the front of each file (be patient, it takes some time for the check to appear).
    Write a small commit message (there's a box for that) that describes your changes briefly. After this task is completed (not yet), both the changes and the message will be seen on GitHub. (Note: It is useful to make commits often and even on small changes. Commits are at the heart of the version control system, as a single commit represents a single version of the file.)
    Press "Commit". (RStudio uses Git to implement the changes included in the commit.)
    Press "Push". (RStudio uses Git to upload the changes to your GitHub repository.)
    Now you can close the "Review Changes" window of RStudio. Good job!! (5 p)
